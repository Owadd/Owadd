## 🚀 About Me
I design systems that take messy, scattered data and turn it into insight engines.  
My work blends **automation**, **machine learning**, and **end-to-end analytics** to eliminate bottlenecks and deliver intelligence at scale.

I’ve built pipelines that feed **millions of viewers**, dashboards used by **decision-makers**, and models that predict, classify, or detect patterns with real-world impact.

I don’t just analyze data — I **engineer the workflows** around it.
